Search for books and their descriptions through google API, save your favorites and add them to your reading list with this MERN app.

## Description
This is a MERN stack, single page app that keeps track of UI components, updates the state dynamically, and follows RESTful API guidlines. API routes connecting to the database are set up in the server using Express.js and Axios in order for the client to make requests and change the state accordingly.

## Practicality
With this app, users can now explore google books to find a book that they like and save it in order to keep track of the ones they'd like to read in the future. When users search for a book, they can view the author, image, and description of that book.
